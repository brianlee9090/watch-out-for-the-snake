## Game instructions

### How to start the game
1. To start the game with enter and you can play with either:  
I. your keyboard (make sure your hands are outside the frame)  
II. your right hand (make sure your right hand is in the frame)  

2. Scripts to run:
I. To play the game with your keyboard please step this step and go to step II.
   To play the game with your finger, %run ./hand.py.
   Make sure the both programs are running.
II. %run ./main.py to start the game

### How to play
You are the <text color="green" font-weight="bold">chicken</text> and your goal is to eat as many <text color="blue" font-weight="bold">cookies</text> as possible while avoiding the <text color="red" font-weight="bold">snake</text>. 
Some things to keep in mind:
1. Your chicken gets 1 extra chicken friend everytime it eats a cookie
2. As your chicken army grows, your line of chickens moves faster.
3. The snake is smart so it changes position if you succeed in avoiding it.

### End of game
The game ends when:
1. Your chicken hits the snake
2. Your chicken hits any of the walls
3. Your chicken hits one of its friends
